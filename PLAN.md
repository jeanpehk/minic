- testing with Hspec continuosly throughout the project

This project is done mostly as a side project since it is not in curriculum in 2019-2020.
I will work on it when I have time from other courses, especially since I am also working
on a university project that takes a lot of time.

A rough timetable for the project would be:

1. March: Parser
2. April: Type / context checking
3. May: IR
4. June: Codegen
5. July: Finish up
